# crime_compare
Project proposal for Data Incubator

This is the exploratory analysis I've done on two municipal datasets describing crime in cities of Chicago and Washington DC.  
The links for the datasets: [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2), 
[Washington DC](http://data.octo.dc.gov/metadata.aspx?id=3).
