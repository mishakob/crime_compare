# Comparing Chicago and Washington, DC from the crime viewpoint
[Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com)  Capstone project.

This is the analysis I've done on two municipal datasets describing crime in cities of [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) and [Washington DC](http://data.octo.dc.gov/metadata.aspx?id=3).  

For the time being I'm working on data for 2013, planning to scale it up in the future. I'm also planning to transfer the project to Python, currently in R.  

So far I've cleaned up the databases, so that both share the same offense types, and can be compared by that parameter.  
Next stops - analysis of offense times and locations.
